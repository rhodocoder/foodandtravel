Sky Garden boasts three storeys of landscaped gardens lush with South African and Medterranean plants, observation decks, an open-air terrace, two restaurants, a bar and an uninterrupted panorama of the city's skyline. Entry is free, but visitors must book their 90-minute timeslot at least three days in advance on the Sky Garden website.</p>

                    <p> Le Jules Verne is a restaurant seen by almost all who come to Paris yet few realise it’s there. Raised, mezzanine-style, above the viewing platforms on the second floor of the Eiffel Tower, this Michelin-starred eatery offers peerless views of Paris, from its most momentous landmark.

Words are hard to describe the amazing view over the „Little Paris”, the electric and dramatic roofbar interior or the glamour and stylish nightview, so that is why we are waiting for you at anytime.</p>

                    <p>For us, this restaurant is all about the view. The food is good and won’t disappoint, but what makes this venue stand out is the panoramic views of the city’s downtown. Enjoy Luxembourg at night from the Gare to the Grund with everything in between. They also have an exceptional cocktail bar made all the more enjoyable by the recent smoking ban. You don’t need a room in the hotel to dine in the restaurant but maybe after a night of spectacular views and drinks, you’ll want one!

Dine on fork-tender seafood and premium steaks while feasting your eyes on the city's vast skyline. Moon Bar puts you at ease in an informal setting 61 floors above the city and offers premium drinks, such as the classic Vertigo Sunset, a melody of pineapple, cranberry and lime juices blended with just the right amount of Malibu.</p>

                    <p>No other restaurant in Tokyo has a setting to rival Kozue. Perched far above the fray on the 40th floor of the Park Hyatt, Kozue is still as swish as the day it opened in 1994, with a contemporary look (soaring ceiling, stylish tables and chairs) to match the confident modern inflections on kaiseki (japan's version of haute cuisine). The menu features torafugu puffer fish in winter, ayu sweetfish in summer, matsutake mushrooms in autumn, and year-round shabu-shabu of perfectly marbled beef from premium wagyu cattle. Book a window seat to enjoy a peerless view of the western hills and even (if the weather gods are smiling) Mt Fuji's cone silhouetted in the distance.

                    </h2>
                    <p>Housed in one of Hong Kong's most iconic landmarks and considered a historical site dating back to 1888, The Pawn brings you an exciting restaurant and bar concept in a unique space that was once the famous Woo Cheong pawnshop. After extensive renovations in the summer of 2014, The Pawn reopened in collaboration with celebrated British chef, Tom Aikens and now offers both traditional and modern British cuisine across two floors, the 'Botanicals' bar and second floor 'Kitchen'.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>Asilo, which apparently means refuge or shelter in Spanish, does indeed provide a refreshing reprieve from the noisy chaos of Mumbai. This hot new bar, located on the 38th floor rooftop of the luxurious St. Regis hotel (formerly the Palladium hotel), has the honor of being Mumbai's highest bar (the St. Regis hotel has another highest bar, Li Bai, on the 37th floor too). If you're not coming for the sunset, expect to pay a full cover charge of 2,500 rupees (redeemable on food and beverages) after 8 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. There's a DJ and the bar fills up fast with an elite crowd.
